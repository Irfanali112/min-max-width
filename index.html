        <P>
            Although these ideas may look true in many instances, they donâ€™t really define what the idea behind a
            paragraph is. This is one of those subtle things in English writing that never really gets explained on
            priority making it one of those commonly used things that are barely understood. Which is why this read is
            going to be great.
